# FoodHub-app
An android app to help you choose food items from a menu and place an order from your account. 

I have used Kotlin for writing the entire application. I used JSON for sending and receiving requests. I have used RecyclerView to display the various items in the app. 
I have also made use of SQLite Database to locally store the restaurants as favourites and the order history. You can easily create your account or log in, if you already have an account and go through the restaurants to order your favourite food items. Enjoy!
